### __Heredity__  
Although it is not the same as life itself, heredity is a very interesting function of life.  
For example, the metabolism of alcohol is said to be genetically related.   About 44% of Japanese people do not have ALDH2, the enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde, or their function is weak and acetaldehyde tends to accumulate.  
My maternal grandfather was an alcoholic, my father was an alcoholic and I cannot drink alcohol because I do not have an alcohol-degrading enzyme (it does not suit my constitution).  

In February 2022, I had to undergo a full examination for suspected glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease that causes a loss of vision, but according to my doctor, this is a complication of the myopia I inherited from my parents (because the proteins in my eyes are constitutionally prone to oval deformation) and is "100% genetic".
