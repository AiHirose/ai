## - __What is Life? How would you define it, can you actually define it?__  
Life is defined by many factors. Respiration, metabolism, self-replication, etc.  

### __Heredity__  
Although it is not the same as life itself, heredity is a very interesting function of life.  
For example, the metabolism of alcohol is said to be genetically related.   About 44% of Japanese people do not have ALDH2, the enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde, or their function is weak and acetaldehyde tends to accumulate.  
My maternal grandfather was an alcoholic, my father was an alcoholic and I cannot drink alcohol because I do not have an alcohol-degrading enzyme (it does not suit my constitution).  

In February 2022, I had to undergo a full examination for suspected glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease that causes a loss of vision, but according to my doctor, this is a complication of the myopia I inherited from my parents (because the proteins in my eyes are constitutionally prone to oval deformation) and is "100% genetic".

## - __What is BioHacking? What does it mean for you?__  

I was not familiar with this field so I looked into it. In dictionary examples, it seems that biohacking can also be described as "Sunday laborer biology," "garage biology," "amateur genetic engineering," and so on.  
Tools and equipment for biohacking can be easily purchased online, which means that biohacking is a buzzword that brings together the high-tech, wellness, anti-aging, and science communities. Some dictionaries refer to it as "using biology to help one's own body function more efficiently." The most basic seems to be that it means to allow the body and mind to function better.  

私はこの分野に詳しくなかったので、調べてみました。辞書の例文などでは、バイオハッキングは、「日曜大工の生物学」、「ガレージ生物学」、「アマチュア遺伝子工学」などとも形容されるようです。  
バイオハッキングのためのツールや機器は、オンラインで簡単に購入することができ、バイオハッキングは、ハイテク、ウェルネス、アンチエイジング、科学のコミュニティを結びつける流行語であるということです。「生物学を用いて自身の身体がより効率良く機能するようにすること」としている辞書もあります。最も基本的なことは、身体や心がより良く機能するようにすることを意味するということのようです。

## - __Why are you interested in Bio?__  
I joined BHA because I am interested in food tech technologies such as cultured meat, plant-based meat, and 3D food printers.
